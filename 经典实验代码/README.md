[spectrev2] https://github.com/Anton-Cao/spectrev2-poc
What can you learn from this code: This code is very simple but it describes a really impactful attack, which won the only 1 Best Paper Award in IEEE S&P 2019 and has more than 3000 citations until the time of writing this Readme file.

[Mastik] https://github.com/Secure-AI-Systems-Group/Mastik
What can you learn from this code: Run one of the most popular attacks (cache side channel attack) and extract real data from shared hardware by yourself.

[Hertzbleed] https://github.com/FPSG-UIUC/hertzbleed
What can you learn from this code: This is one of the best attack in recent 3 years and you can learn how modern DVFS design introduces addtional security risks.

[bigger-fish] https://github.com/jackcook/bigger-fish
What can you learn from this code: Use machine learning to assist side channel attack and recognize why we should be careful throughout our research.

[mwait] https://github.com/cispa/mwait
What can you learn from this code: This repo is well-organized and clearly documents the requirements of software and hardware for each experiment.

[SysBumps] https://github.com/koreacsl/SysBumps
What can you learn from this code: If you want to try Apple side channel, this code is much easier to run compared to other Apple side channel work.
